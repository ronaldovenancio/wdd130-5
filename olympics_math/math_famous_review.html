            <h2>Some Famous Math Olympics in Brazil</h2>
           
            <p>The Brazilian Mathematics Olympiad <a href="https://www.obm.org.br"        target="_blank">(OBM)</a> is a program of the Brazilian Mathematics Society <a href="https://sbm.org.br" target="_blank">(SBM)</a> and the Brazilian Mathematics Olympiad Association <a href="https://www.associacaodaobm.org" target="_blank">(AOBM)</a>. In addition to holding the annual edition of the Olympics throughout Brazil, the OBM organizing committee is responsible for selecting and training Brazilian teams that participate in international competitions, such as the International Mathematical Olympiad <a href="https://impa.br/acervo/imo2017/index.html" target="_blank">(IMO)</a>, Ibero-American Mathematics Olympiad <a href="https://imomath.com/index.cgi?page=collectionIb" target="_blank">(IMO).</a> and International Mathematics Competition for University Students  <a href="https://www.imc-math.org.uk" target="_blank">(IMC).</a></p>

            <p>According to the director of IMPA, Obmep makes an invaluable social and educational contribution. “Especially in needier areas of the country, the Olympics opens up opportunities for personal and professional growth because a medal or an honorable mention represents an opportunity for many of these children to change their lives”, he highlighted.</p>

            <p>Public and private schools can enroll students in the Brazilian Public School Mathematics Olympiads <a href="https://www.obmep.org.br" target="_blank">(Obmep)</a>, held by the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics <a href="https://impa.br/" target="_blank">(IMPA)</a>, which is linked to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. Obmep is the largest scientific competition in the country and brings together, every year, more than 18 million students from the 6th year of Elementary School to the 3rd year of High School from all states and the Federal District.</p>

            <p>In Brazil we have some of more important math olympics such as Math Olympics of Unicamp <a href="https://www.olimpiada.ime.unicamp.br" target="_blank">(OMU)</a> and Math Olympics Brazilian (OBM). Several other math olympics are very known, for example, Obmep.</p>

            <p>There is many Mathematical Olympiads in  the world. The first of the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMOs) was held in Romania in 1959. The oldest of the International Science Olympiads, the IMO has since been held annually, except in 1980. Many countries have math olympics every year and the students of many countries have had excellent performance in this internation competition.</p>

            <h2>Some Brazilian Achievemnent in Math Olympics</h2>
            
            <p>In 2023, Brazil ranked 16th in the general ranking of the 64th International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO), the largest mathematical competition at student level. The Brazilian team won 6 medals: 1 gold, 2 silver and 3 bronze. The competition took place on the 8th and 9th of July, in the city of Chiba in Japan. </p>

           <p>For IMPA's deputy director, Claudio Landim, general coordinator of OBMEP (Brazilian Public School Mathematics Olympiad), the team's result was an important achievement. “It is important to highlight that all the countries in the top 10 offer intensive training for their teams, which does not occur in Brazil, where training for scientific research is prioritized as opposed to preparation for the Olympics.”</p>

           <p>IMO has been held since 1959 and awards young high school students from more than 100 countries. Brazil joined the scientific competition in 1979 and has already won 158 medals, 14 gold, 55 silver and 89 bronze, in addition to 35 honorable mentions.</p>

           <p>In 2022, the Brazilian team ranked 19th in the world, with two gold medals – an unprecedented performance for Brazil at the Olympics – in addition to one silver, two bronze and one honorable mention. </p>

           <p><b>Medals -</b> This year, OBMEP multiplied the number of medals for those registered. 650 gold, 1,950 silver and 5,850 bronze medals will be distributed to participants from public and private units. Students who win these medals will be invited to participate in the Jr. Scientific Initiation Program (PIC) as an incentive and promotion of academic development.
            In addition to the increase in medals, the big news in this edition is the regional awards. There will be at least 20,500 recipients and the number of medals will be calculated according to the performance of each federative unit. The regional award will be the responsibility of the local coordination and does not allow access to the Junior Initiation Program.
            </p>
            
            <p>“This increase aims to stimulate student participation, encourage the study of the subject and improve mathematics teaching in Brazil. This is our main objective”, said the general coordinator of Obmep, Claudio Landim.</p>
